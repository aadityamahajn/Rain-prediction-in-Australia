# Prediction Analysis for Next-Day Rain Prediction in Australia
### Project Overeview
Develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of rain for the next day in various locations across Australia.

### Data Source
Utilizing the "Rain in Australia" dataset from Kaggle, This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.

### Objective
- Utilize a dataset containing 10 years of daily weather observations from various Australian locations.
- Train and evaluate different classification models to predict the binary target variable "RainTomorrow" (Yes/No).
- Achieve a high level of accuracy in predicting the next day's rain occurrence.
- Provide insights into the factors influencing rain prediction through the chosen model.

### Result
- Overall Summary: Random Forest & Logestic Regression slightly performs better than the other machine learning models.
- Goal: Utilized this dataset with 10 years of daily weather observations from various Australian locations and achieved an accuracy upto 85.16% in predicting the next day's rain occurrence.
- Recommendation: Considering the presence of null values in the current dataset, I recommend incorporating real-time weather data to address this issue and potentially improve the predictive modeling performance.
